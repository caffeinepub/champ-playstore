## Summary
**Goal:** Build a comprehensive app discovery platform (Champ Playstore) where users can browse, search, and review apps across multiple categories.

**Planned changes:**
- Create backend data model for apps with fields: ID, name, description, developer, category, version, file size, rating, reviews count, downloads, icon URL, screenshots, and release date
- Implement backend functions for retrieving all apps, filtering by category, searching by name/developer, and getting app details by ID
- Build backend system for app categories (Games, Social, Productivity, Entertainment, Education, Tools)
- Implement ratings and reviews system allowing users to submit 1-5 star ratings and text reviews, with automatic average rating calculation
- Create home page displaying featured apps, popular apps sorted by downloads, and horizontally scrollable category sections with app cards
- Build search interface with real-time filtering as users type, showing matching results with icons, names, categories, and ratings
- Implement category browsing pages with grid layout and sorting options (popularity, rating, name)
- Create detailed app pages showing full information including large icon, screenshots gallery, description, developer info, ratings summary, and user reviews list
- Add review submission interface on app detail pages with star rating selector and text input
- Design vibrant, modern app store interface with bold color scheme, card-based layouts, smooth transitions, and clear typography hierarchy

**User-visible outcome:** Users can browse a modern app store interface, discover apps through categories or search, view detailed app information with screenshots and reviews, and submit their own ratings and reviews for apps.
